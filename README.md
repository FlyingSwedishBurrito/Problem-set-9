# Problem-set-9
 python projects

edit 1: have all the files upload, but have a problem with de-encrypting problem9.3

edit 1.1: figured it out! simple typo. 

edit 2: went back and tried to edit some stuff for problem set 2 and then got all these dumb syntax errors. So i wrote all the code over into 9.2.2

edit 2.1: renamed 9.2.2 to 9.2

problem 9.1 - simple hello world with input for name
problem 9.2 - takes user input and creates a hashtage pyramid
problem 9.3 - takes user input to create a ceasar cypher
problem 9.4 - creates a true pyramid.
